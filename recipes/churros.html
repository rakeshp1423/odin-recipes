        <h2>Descriptoin</h2>
        <p>Churros are traditional Spanish desserts. They are made from dough pastry-predominantly choux- which is fried and dusted in cinnamon sugar. They are popular in Spain, France, the Philippines, Portugal, South America and Southwestern United States. They can be long and thin or thick, straight or twisted and knotted.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
            <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Editor's Note</h2>
        <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.</p>
